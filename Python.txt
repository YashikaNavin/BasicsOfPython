# Introduction:
Python is a high-level, object oriented and multipurpose programming language.
It supports multile programming pattern i.e. object oreiented as well as structured programming language.
It is used to develop different appplications such as:-
                -- Console based application(eg: Ipython) 
                -- GUI based application(eg: calculator, TextEditor)
                -- Web applications(eg: Instagram, Pinterest)
                -- Gaming applications(eg: Tic-Tac-Toe, Snake game)
                -- Image processing
                -- Text processing

# History:
Python is developed by "Guido Van Rossum". He is known as the father of python.
He developed python at National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in The Netherlands.
Its first version i.e. Version !.0 was released in 1994.

# Features:
1. Simple - It uses english like words
2. Platform independent
3. Interpreted - It is processed at run time by the interpreter(which compiles the code line by line)
4. Portable
5. Object-Oriented
6. Multi-threaded - Supports multi threading
7. Dynamically typed - As we don't need to use data types to declare a variable

**The interpreter used in python is Cpython. The coding of interpreter is in C language.

# Examples of various applications based on python are:- BitTorrent, Youtube, Dropbox, Cinema4D, etc.

# 3 Ways to Create Program in Python:
1. Interactive mode (directly working on cmd)
2. Script mode (working with notepad and cmd)
3. IDLE mode (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)

# Variable:
Variables are reserved memory locations which store values. They are examples of identifiers.

#Identifier:
Identifiers are the names given by user to something to identify.
Rules:-
1. First character of identifier must be an umderscore(_), or a letter.
2. Rest of the characters in identifier can be '_', letter or number/digit.
3. Special characters like @,$,%,etc. are not allowed in identifier.

#Data Types:
Variable can hold value or data of different types called data types.
It consists of:-
1. numbers
2. string
3. list
4. tuple
5. dictionary
Data types can be of two types i.e., either mutable or immutable.
